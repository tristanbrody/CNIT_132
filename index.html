            Search engines index websites by use of an internet bot called a 'web crawler'. The information available when you search on Google or Yahoo is based on the 
            results scraped by these crawlers.
        </li>
        <li>
            Web crawlers following the 'robots exclusion protocol' (such as Google's) look for a robots.txt file in the root folder of a given website. This file allows you to
            specify specific pages on your website that web crawlers should ignore.

            As more and more people access the Internet primarily using mobile devices, designing sites for mobile first has become a critical element of effective SEO. 
            The recommended approach since the release of CSS3 is via media queries, which allow you to host one page for mobile and desktop, but show different content and 
            design based on the type of device accessing the page.

            External links to your website will generally increase your ranking on Google search results. One exploit used for so-called 'black hat SEO' (meaning SEO tactics
            that violate Google's policies) is paying people to post links to your website, in order to increase your ranking in Google's algorithm.
